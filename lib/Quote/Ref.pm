=head1 NAME

Quote::Ref - qw for array/hash references

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Quote::Ref;

 my $aref = qwa(foo bar baz);  # $aref = [ qw(foo bar baz) ]
 my $href = qwh(foo 1 bar 2);  # $href = { qw(foo 1 bar 2) }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the new keywords C<qwa> and C<qwh>.

=head2 qwa

C<qwa> is a quoting operator like L<q or qq|perlop/Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators>.
It works like C<qw> in that it parses its contents as a list of whitespace
separated words, but instead of turning them into a list, it turns them into an
array reference. That is, C<qwa!...!> works like C<[ qw!...! ]>.

=head2 qwh

C<qwh> is a quoting operator like L<q or qq|perlop/Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators>.
It works like C<qw> in that it parses its contents as a list of whitespace
separated words, but instead of turning them into a list, it turns them into an
hash reference. That is, C<qwh!...!> works like C<{ qw!...! }>.
